# Voice Imprint Studio

**Status:** In Development
**Version:** v1.37+

## Overview

Voice Imprint Studio is a planned application for analyzing voice patterns and creating unique resonance profiles. This tool will explore the acoustic fingerprint of voices and their relationship to emotional resonance.

## Planned Features

### Phase 1: Basic Analysis
- [ ] Voice recording interface
- [ ] Waveform visualization
- [ ] Basic frequency analysis
- [ ] Pattern detection

### Phase 2: Resonance Profiling
- [ ] Harmonic analysis
- [ ] Emotional state correlation
- [ ] OXY/DOP/ADR mapping
- [ ] Resonance profile generation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Voice comparison tools
- [ ] Historical pattern tracking
- [ ] Machine learning integration
- [ ] Export and sharing capabilities

## Technical Stack

**Planned Technologies:**
- Web Audio API for audio processing
- Canvas/WebGL for visualization
- TensorFlow.js for ML (optional)
- IndexedDB for local storage

## Research Questions

This application aims to explore:
1. How do voice characteristics correlate with resonance patterns?
2. Can we identify emotional states from voice analysis?
3. What makes a voice "resonate" with listeners?
4. How do voice patterns change over time?

## Integration

Voice Imprint Studio will integrate with:
- **Resonance Player:** Share voice-based resonance data
- **Arcadia:** Document findings and patterns
- **Airth:** Validate research claims about voice-emotion correlations
