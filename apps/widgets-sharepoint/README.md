# SharePoint / Teams Widgets

Drop-in HTML snippets for enhancing TEC-branded SharePoint pages or Teams tabs.

## Included snippets
- `tec-orb.html` – cursor-following orb that mirrors the TEC palette; embed via the SharePoint “Embed” webpart or host in SiteAssets and iframe it elsewhere.

## Usage
1. Upload the HTML file to `SiteAssets/widgets/`.
2. In SharePoint, add an Embed webpart and reference the file URL.
3. In Teams, add a “Website” tab pointing at the hosted widget.

Extend this folder with additional SVG banners, Markdown cards, or loop components as the aesthetic evolves.
