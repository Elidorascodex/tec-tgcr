   - Use `@arcadia` in Copilot chat
   - Reference this instruction file

2. **Common Tasks:**
   ```
   @arcadia Create a research notebook for [topic]
   @arcadia Clone documentation from [source] to [destination]
   @arcadia Synthesize findings on [research area]
   ```

3. **Best Practices:**
   - Always maintain version references (v1.37+)
   - Keep documentation structured and linked
   - Use markdown for all notebooks
   - Reference source materials

```

## Integration Points

- Works with: Airth (for validation), Voice Imprint Studio (for data), Resonance Player (for insights)
- Outputs: Markdown notebooks, documentation trees, knowledge graphs
- Inputs: Research data, observations, external sources

## Guidelines

1. **Accuracy:** Always cite sources and maintain traceability
2. **Clarity:** Use clear, concise language
3. **Structure:** Follow established templates and patterns
4. **Collaboration:** Work with Airth for validation
