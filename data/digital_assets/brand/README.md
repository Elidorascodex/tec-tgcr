LuminAI brand assets

Location: data/digital_assets/brand/svg/

Files:

- luminai_mascot_logo.svg — Primary vector mascot (axolotl–bee hybrid). Imported 2025-10-27.

Notes & proposed fixes (implemented as of 2025-10-27):

- Antennae: tip circles replaced with masked crescent shapes plus small inner circle accents to match requested aesthetics.
- Palette: increased spec highlight (var(--white)) to pure white for crisper highlights; gradients preserved.

Requested next steps (please confirm):

1) Review the updated SVG and confirm antenna silhouette and color balance. If you want different crescent thickness, direction, or offset, tell me the preference (left/right arc; more or less "bite").
2) If approved, I will export PNGs at these sizes: 1024, 512, 256, 120 (for favicon) and place them in data/digital_assets/brand/png/.
3) I can also produce a monochrome/stroke-only variant for favicons and embroidery use.
4) I can open a small branch with these asset changes and a PR, plus update docs/branding/luminai.md to reference the new assets and add usage guidance.

How to preview locally:

- Open the SVG in your browser or a vector editor (Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator). The file is at:

If you'd like me to proceed with exports and a PR, reply: "Export PNGs & PR". If you'd like further tweaks first, reply with the tweaks (e.g., "Make crescents thinner and rotate 15° clockwise").
