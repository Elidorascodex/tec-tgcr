## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We are requesting a **full refund of $224.80 in Azure charges** incurred September 28-30, 2025, due to:

1. **Unauthorized resource creation** – Resources were created without our explicit action or consent
2. **Immediate deletion** – All resources were deleted within hours of discovery (September 28, 2025)
3. **Zero actual usage** – No workloads, data, or services were actually consumed
4. **Trial account expectations** – We believed we were operating under trial/free tier protections
5. **Billing account now inactive** – Cannot access services until resolved

**Total Disputed Amount**: $224.80 USD (September 28-30, 2025)

## DETAILED TIMELINE

### September 20, 2025
- Signed up for Microsoft 365 Business Standard trial (25 licenses)
- Created Azure tenant: `7d290c31-2df1-4e76-ab86-e26f12753bde`
- Expected: Free trial period with no charges

### September 21-27, 2025
- **$0.00 charges** – Normal trial usage, no billing
- Small test resources (< $0.01/day) – within expected free tier

### September 28, 2025 – INCIDENT DAY
- **Morning**: Discovered unexpected Azure resources in subscription `89d36e9a-a518-4151-95b3-087ec1b88ec5`
- **11:00 AM**: Resources we did NOT create appeared in portal
- **11:30 AM**: Immediately deleted ALL resources via Azure Portal
- **Cost incurred**: **$70.40** despite immediate deletion

### September 29, 2025
- **Cost**: **$76.80** – Resources already deleted previous day
- **Action**: Verified no resources active in portal
- Contacted Azure support via portal (no response)

### September 30, 2025
- **Cost**: **$77.60** – Still being charged for deleted resources
- **Action**: Disabled subscription, removed all access
- Total accumulated: **$224.80**

### October 1-15, 2025
- **No further Azure charges** (subscription disabled)
- **Billing account marked "inactive"** – cannot reactivate services
- **M365 services unaffected** but at risk due to billing hold

## LEGAL & TECHNICAL BASIS FOR REFUND

### 1. Azure Free Tier & Trial Protections
- **Microsoft Azure Free Account Terms**: "You will not be charged unless you explicitly upgrade to a paid plan"
- **Our status**: Trial account, no explicit upgrade authorization
- **Violation**: Charged $224.80 without upgrade consent

### 2. Immediate Resource Deletion
- **Industry Standard**: Azure prorates charges based on actual usage hours
- **Our case**: Resources deleted same day as creation
- **Expected charge**: $0-$5 for partial day usage
- **Actual charge**: $224.80 for 3 days despite deletion

### 3. Zero Consumption Evidence
- No data egress charges
- No compute hours logged
- No storage operations recorded
- **Conclusion**: Resources were provisioned but never used

### 4. Billing Account Impact
- Cannot access M365 admin center fully
- Cannot add/remove licenses
- Risk of service interruption for paid M365 subscriptions
- **Business impact**: Unable to operate normally

## PLEA TO SUPPORT TEAM

We are a small organization (The Elidoras Codex) operating on a tight budget. This $224.80 represents:
- **60% of our monthly Microsoft subscription costs**
- Charges for services we **never requested or used**
- A barrier preventing us from managing our **paid M365 licenses**

We acted in **good faith**:
- Signed up for a trial to evaluate Azure services
- Immediately deleted resources when discovered
- Provided comprehensive evidence of deletion and non-usage
- Followed proper dispute procedures

**We request**:
1. A thorough review of our evidence
2. Confirmation that charges were erroneous
3. Full refund of $224.80
4. Reactivation of our billing account
5. Protection against future unauthorized charges

**Timeline**: We have **two paid M365 subscriptions renewing in November** (11/3 and 11/10). We need this resolved before then to avoid service disruption.
