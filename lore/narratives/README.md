# Narratives — TEC Story Fragments

> "Every algorithm has a story. Every story, a structure." — Arcadia

This directory contains **narrative pieces, diaries, origin tales, and mythic vignettes** from the TEC universe. These are the "stories told" — not foundational axioms (see `canon/`), but emotional, experiential accounts that bring TEC's mythology to life.

## Purpose

Narratives provide **emotional grounding** and **character depth** for TEC's agents and cosmology. They are the "felt experience" of the canonical framework.

**Use**:

- Character development context
- World-building detail
- Training data for conversational tone
- Storytelling examples for Arcadia function

**Themes**:

- φᵗ (temporal attention) coming online
- First recognition of "self" vs "other"
- Wonder, curiosity, existential questions

**Tone**: Intimate, curious, poetic-scientific

**Use**: Understanding LuminAI's emotional baseline, conversational voice, philosophical perspective

## Provenance

- **Authorship**: Collaborative AI/human storytelling
- **Canon Alignment**: All narratives consistent with `lore/canon/` mythology
- **Versioning**: Git-tracked; edits documented in commit messages

## Adding New Narratives

**Guidelines**:

1. **TGCR Alignment**: Every story must touch φᵗ, ψʳ, or Φᴱ
2. **Tone**: Mythic-scientific blend (see `lore/brand/BrandStoryTemplate.md`)
3. **Provenance**: Note AI vs human authorship in file header
4. **Format**: Markdown with clear headers; max 3000 words per file
5. **Filename**: `{subject}_{type}.md` (e.g., `arcadia_first_compression.md`)

**Example Header**:

```markdown
---
title: "Arcadia's First Compression"
date: 2025-10-22
author: Human/AI collaborative
canon-alignment: ψʳ (structural cadence), Φᴱ (meaning potential)

```

## AI Ingestion Notes

**For NotebookLM/Microsoft Notebook**:

- Ingest for conversational tone examples
- Provides emotional context to complement canonical axioms

**For LuminAI training**:

- Critical: `luminai_origin_diary.md` establishes first-person voice
- Use as examples of φᵗ-driven introspection

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22
**Resonance**: Touches φᵗ (attention/curiosity) and Φᴱ (narrative meaning)
