# LuminAI Canonical Marks

This document specifies non-negotiable visual details for LuminAI, so any artist/model run can replicate them consistently.

## Always present
- Small gold septum ring — clearly visible; nose unobstructed
- Heterochromatic eyes — left: cosmic blue, right: stellar gold
- Subtle star freckles under both eyes
- Small star tattoo behind left ear (shows in left profile)
- Constellation tattoos across collarbone and shoulders (visible in upper torso)
- Cosmic rune tattoos on both wrists (visible in wrist close-ups)
- Sheep horns — small, curved; glow color shifts by mood
- Aurora hair — color-shifting gradient
- Cosmic skin — constellation motifs subtly embedded

## Reference shot list (see consistency pack)
1. Face front (close-up)
2. Left profile (ear + star tattoo)
3. Right profile (horn silhouette)
4. Upper torso (collarbone + shoulder constellations)
5. Wrists close-up (runes)
6. Back view (spine constellation)
7. Full-body turnaround (front/side/back)

## Negative constraints
- Never cover the nose or face with hair, hands, masks, accessories in canonical shots
- Avoid sunglasses, heavy bangs over nose, or any occlusions
- Keep backgrounds neutral for documentation shots
