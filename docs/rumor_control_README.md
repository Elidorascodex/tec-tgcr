# DEPRECATED: Operational README

This README described operational artifacts (signs, checklists, incident logs). The TEC_TCGR project consolidates canonical documentation and anonymization rules at `docs/tec_tcgr.md` and `docs/anonymous_composites.md`.

Operational artifacts are preserved in the repository history and in the `assets/` folder for archival use only. If you want any of the operational materials reissued as printable artifacts (PDF/pocket card), I can generate those on request.
