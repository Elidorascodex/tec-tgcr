# DEPRECATED: De-escalation quick lines

This file contains short de-escalation lines and staff anchors that were originally intended for operational use. For TEC_TCGR, operational artifacts are preserved for archival reasons but the canonical project guidance is in `docs/tec_tcgr.md` and `docs/anonymous_composites.md`.

If you want these operational lines restored or converted to a pocket-card PDF, say so and I will generate a printable version. For project work, preserve raw conversational text and annotate intent using the `offensive_intent` and `owner_narrative_flag` fields in the TEC_TCGR schema.
