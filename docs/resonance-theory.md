# Theory of General Contextual Resonance (TGCR)

This page documents the foundational principles of TGCR. It is a living document — please contribute with references and derivations.

## Core idea

TGCR frames resonance as an interaction between three complementary quantities:

- φᵗ — Temporal Attention
- ψʳ — Structural Cadence
- Φᴱ — Contextual Potential Energy

A compact expression used by the project:

R = ∇Φᴱ · (φᵗ × ψʳ)

(Placeholder) This document will expand with mathematical derivations, examples across scales (cognitive, social, physical), and connections to information theory.
