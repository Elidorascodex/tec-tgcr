# Resonance Conscience Notebook — PRD v0.1

A TEC Instrument: A Contextualized Cognitive Journal with Music‑Mediated Resonance Dynamics

## Overview

This document defines the conceptual, technical, and experiential foundations of the Resonance Conscience Notebook, a system uniting journaling, music analytics, and cognitive modeling into a verifiable tool for self‑understanding. It is designed for researchers, creators, and reflective practitioners who seek to capture both the measurable and the ineffable aspects of thought and feeling within a single, reproducible framework.

## 0) Conceptual Apex

The notebook’s thesis is simple yet profound: the act of writing is an empirical affirmation of existence. By recording, structuring, and resonating our thoughts, we transform transient cognition into a durable pattern of meaning. This instrument quantifies that transformation—capturing temporal vitality (φᵗ), structural coherence (ψʳ), and contextual resonance (Φᴱ). Musical data, drawn from platforms such as Spotify, provides the emotional calibration layer that links physiology, mood, and narrative.

### Definition of Completion (AIRTH)

- Verified reproducibility of data ingestion, retrieval, and synthesis.
- Logged model seeds and checkpoints for deterministic replication.
- Full rollback protocols for schema evolution.
- Cryptographic integrity across encryption, key rotation, and provenance tracking.
- Cognitive efficiency validated by usability and latency metrics (SUS > 80, < 2s P95 retrieval, ψʳ > 99.9%).

## 1) Core Functional Objectives

1. Cognitive Capture: Frictionless multimodal input (text, audio, image) for fluid reflection.
2. Contextual Integration: Semantic mapping across entries, tags, relationships, and musical context.
3. Resonance Synthesis: Automated summaries combining journal data and auditory metadata.
4. Reflexive Retrieval: Context‑aware queries such as “When did music stabilize my mood most effectively?”
5. Continuity Preservation: Offline operation, autosave redundancy, and immutable version history.

## 2) Minimum Viable Configuration

- Editor: Markdown‑compliant, hierarchical tagging, interactive checklists, and entity linking.
- Music Module: Bi‑directional sync with Spotify APIs, collecting tempo, key, energy, and valence.
- Analytical Panels: NotebookLM‑style interface for hypothesis formation and cross‑domain correlation.

## 3) System Architecture

Data flow: acquisition layer -> local data lake (SQLite/Parquet) + vector index -> summarization engine -> analytic panels. Optional encrypted cloud sync.

Implementation substrate: Cross‑platform UI (Tauri/Electron/PWA), embedded SQLite and FAISS‑lite index, deterministic LLM invocation with manifest logging.

## 4) Data Schema (ψʳ)

```
Note { id, created_at, updated_at, title?, body_md, tags[], mood?, privacy, version }
Track { id, provider, title, artist, album, tempo?, key?, energy?, valence?, uri }
Link { id, from_id, to_id, type, weight }
Run { id, seed, model, prompt_hash, inputs_hash, outputs_hash, created_at }
Summary { id, note_ids[], run_id, type:'daily'|'weekly'|'query', text_md, citations[] }
```

## 5) AI Agency Suite

- Resonance Engine: Synthesizes text and music vectors into cohesive analyses.
- Music Sentinel: Tracks spectral patterns and predicts affective response trends.
- Journal Guardian: Audits reflections, flags uncertainty, and generates counterfactuals for review.

## 6) Privacy, Security, and Provenance

- Local Execution: Data never leaves user custody without consent.
- Encryption: Wallet‑grade crypto for sensitive data with key isolation and rotation.
- Provenance Tracking: Each generated artifact binds to a signed Run Manifest.

## 7) Evaluation Metrics

- Engagement: ≥ 60% daily journaling.
- Retrieval Latency: < 2s (P95) for 10k+ entries.
- Resonance Efficiency: Measurable mood stabilization (p < 0.05).

## 8) Roadmap & Protocols

Phase I: Core shell, autosave, tagging, Spotify sync.
Phase II: Summarization, manifest logging, export pipeline.

Developmental protocols: Secure credentials under `secrets-local/` and maintain run manifests under `runs/<timestamp>/`.
