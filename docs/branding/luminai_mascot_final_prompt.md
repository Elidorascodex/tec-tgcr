# LuminAI — Mascot Visual Style Guide (Final Author’s Specification)

This is the definitive, implementable visual specification for the LuminAI mascot. It supersedes earlier notes and is tied directly to the canonical SVG at `data/digital_assets/brand/svg/luminai_mascot_logo.svg`. Use this doc for final vector edits and for rendering pipelines.

## Core Specifications

### Eyes

- Left Eye (Purple): iris is a white disk with a centered capital Φ (Phi) glyph. Replace any previous hollow or dot treatment.
- Right Eye (Gold/Yellow): iris is a white disk with a centered lowercase φ (phi) glyph. Replace any previous hollow or dot treatment.

### Antennae Tips

- Each antenna tip has three stacked spheres (top → middle → bottom): Violet, Teal, Gold. Each sphere carries a subtle colored glow matching its hue.

### Tail Ribbons & Stinger

- Three ribbon-like lines wrap around the waist/tail and follow the body silhouette (do not cut across the silhouette):
  - Top stripe: Gold (replaces the teal in earlier drafts).
  - Middle stripe: Teal/Cyan (acts as the ψ wave element).
  - Bottom stripe: Violet (curves with the lower contour of the mascot).
- The three ribbons converge into a single, tapered stinger point; the stinger visually continues the three lines (a unified, stretched termination) rather than appearing as an isolated dot.

### Geometric Flow & Psi Wave

- Yellow, Teal, and Purple curves must trace outer geometry (follow silhouette). The middle teal line is part of an abstract ψ (Psi) waveform: extend it inward to link the tail ribbons to the chest resonance core so the composition reads as a continuous wave.

### Resonance Core (Chest)

- Circular ring with soft cyan glow and a centered ψ glyph. The ring should be visibly linked to the teal waveform coming from the tail.

### Overall Aesthetic

- Emphasize luminosity, symmetry, and smooth motion. All elements should integrate into a cohesive, radiant whole that reads as both playful and ceremonially precise — mythic resonance with modern minimalism.

## Render-ready single-sentence prompt

"A radiant axolotl-bee mascot with luminous gradients and honeycomb wings: left eye purple with a white-disk iris containing a centered capital Φ, right eye gold with a white-disk iris containing a centered lowercase φ; antennae tipped with three stacked spheres (violet, teal, gold) each with a soft glow; three ribbon-like lines (gold top, teal center, violet bottom) that trace the mascot's outer silhouette and curve along the lower contour, the teal ribbon extending inward as an abstract ψ waveform into a cyan-glowing chest ring with a ψ glyph; all ribbons converge into a single tapered stinger point; style: luminous, balanced, mythic-resonant, clean vector lines, soft glows, high-contrast highlights."

If you want: I can produce 2–3 alternate render-ready sentences tuned for different generators (photoreal, stylized vector, or icon-simplified). Say which style and I’ll generate.
