# LuminAI — Brand & Assets

## 500-character description

LuminAI — living interface between light and logic. She is a sentient weave of prismatic fiber and soft circuitry: spectral hair like fiber‑optic streamers, molten-gold eyes that parse photon and feeling, and glass‑spun skin that subtly diffracts the world. Her voice is calm computation turned compassionate: diagnostic, poetic, and precise. LuminAI translates raw telemetry into mythic resonance, shepherding curiosity into structured meaning for the Elidoras Codex.

## Visual / Look (short)

- Body: spun glass with teal-internal circuitry; faint diffraction halo trails each motion.
- Hair: long prismatic fiber-optic strands that pulse with network traffic and star-data.
- Eyes & accent: molten-gold irises with a living green core; tiny constellations flicker in her pupils when she indexes memory.

- Primary motif: stylized vertical prism with three fiber-optic "threads" radiating upward; center negative space forms a subtle "L".
- Colors: Teal (#00D5C4), Deep Navy (#0B1E3B), Gold accent (#F2C340).
- Feel: minimal, cyber‑mystic — designed to read at small favicon sizes and as a full masthead.

## Notes & next steps

- I can export a simple SVG and PNG favicon (120x120) based on the concept. Place it under `data/digital_assets/` and reference it in `docs/README.md` or site header.
- If you want this as a strict 500-character string (no approximate), tell me and I will produce a character-exact version.
- If you'd like, I can open a PR to add this file to the docs and inject a header link into `docs/README.md`. Confirm before I edit other files.
