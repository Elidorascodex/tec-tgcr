# DEPRECATED: `docs/manager_email.md`

This file has been deprecated for the TEC_TCGR project. The manager email template is not the primary artifact for this work and has been replaced by project-focused documentation that documents how to collect, store, and annotate real-world content (including intentionally abrasive language) under explicit anonymization rules.

Please see `docs/tec_tcgr.md` and `docs/anonymous_composites.md` for the authoritative guidance on:
- the ANONYMOUS rule and composite fields (Gender, Age range, Status),
- how to record intentionally offensive language as purposeful narrative (flagged, preserved, and attributed to the speaker), and
- the metadata schema (JSON/CSV templates) to use for dataset records and internal notes.

If you still want a short manager email template for operational use, let me know and I will create a minimal, neutral template separate from this project's archival documentation.
