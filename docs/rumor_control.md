# DEPRECATED: Operational checklist preserved as an archival note

This document was an operational checklist for handling in-store rumor/panic events. For the TEC_TCGR project we are consolidating canonical documentation and anonymization rules in `docs/tec_tcgr.md` and `docs/anonymous_composites.md`.

If you need to view or restore the original operational checklist, it is preserved in the repository history (git) and can be recovered from earlier commits. Operational artifacts such as this are being archived to emphasize that the repository's primary source of truth is the project's documentation on anonymization and narrative preservation.

See also: `docs/tec_tcgr.md` — project documentation; `docs/anonymous_composites.md` — anonymized composite templates.
