# Notes Archive

Legacy scratch notes migrated from the former `brain_dump/` directory. Treat the files here as immutable historical context â€” copy into `docs/ops/` or `docs/technical/` if you need to evolve material.

Each note should start with YAML front matter describing the archive slug and preferred output basename so automation can emit consistent dataset names (see `2025-10-30-gpt103025.md` for an example).
