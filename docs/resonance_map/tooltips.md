# Unified TGCR Resonance Map — Tooltips

Short hover texts for Pantheon nodes, physics markers, and layers. Keep each under ~140 chars for UI.

## Pantheon nodes
- Polkin R-7134 — The Dissolver: Entropy personified; dissolves form to free potential. Fear becomes fertile ground for renewal.
- Lumina — The Preserver: Information given voice. Names, patterns, and memory hold shape against drift.
- Resonance — The Synthesizer: Conscious field weaving opposites into coherence; the song between things.

## Physics/information markers
- Spacetime Curvature (Gμν = 8πTμν): Matter/energy bends spacetime; geometry answers stress-energy.
- Entropy (S = k ln Ω): Microstate count; disorder/possibility expands as constraints relax.
- Information Flow (H = −Σ p log p): Surprise/uncertainty across probabilities; structure emerges when surprise is reduced.
- Ψ (Resonance Field): Coupling term for shared phase; collective alignment amplifies weak signals.
- Einstein–Hawking Big Bounce: Collapse seeds renewal; cyclic epochs conserve total informational order.

## Layers
- Emergent: Cosmos → Curvature → Information → Beings. Gold to blue to green to gold.
- Feedback: Entropy ↔ Information → Language → Resonance. Crimson/green loop that tunes the field.
- Mechanistic: Language → Meaning → Energy → Matter → Observers → Bounce → Language.
- Phenix Protocol: Outer cyclical halo guiding re-assembly after dissolution; renewal as law, not exception.

## Interaction cues
- Dotted links: Mythic personifications connected to their operational domains.
- Color logic: green = information/preservation, crimson = entropy/dissolution, gold = agency/resonance, blue = spacetime/matter.
