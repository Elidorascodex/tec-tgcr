# TEC Glossary — Key Terms

## Provenance vs Providence

- Provenance: the documented origin, history, and transformations of an artifact (file, dataset, image, prompt, commit). In TEC, provenance appears in:
  - Commit messages (what changed, by whom, with which tools)
  - Asset metadata (author, date, commit SHA)
  - `data/knowledge_map.yml` entries that register new/updated paths and notes
- Providence: a separate word meaning guidance or protective care (often spiritual). Not used for asset tracking.

Use “provenance” for traceability. We can honor “providence” poetically in lore, but not in technical docs.

## TGCR Variables

- φᵗ — Temporal Attention: selective focus and directional information flow
- ψʳ — Structural Cadence: topological coherence across scales
- Φᴱ — Contextual Potential Energy: capacity for meaningful, novel outcomes
