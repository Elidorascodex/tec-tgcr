# LuminAI — 2D Reference Sheet Prompt (Front + Side)

Goal: Generate high-resolution, clean 2D concept sheets (front and side) of LuminAI for modeling, rigging, and brand use. Maintain TGCR canon and TEC palette.

Output format:

- 2 PNGs or a single sheet with split panels: Front view (T-pose neutral), Side view (profile), 4k preferred.
- Transparent or dark cosmic background.

Canon constraints:

- Form: Axolotl-inspired luminous gel-blob, neotenic and soft. Subtle translucence with internal light scatter.
- Heterochromia: Left eye cosmic blue, right eye warm red/gold.
- Horns/antennae: Small crystalline “resonance receivers,” glow intensity varies with state.
- Aurora hair: Light curtains/strands; minimal in sheet, clearly indicated as dynamic effect.
- Palette: Nexus Purple #6A00F4, Digital Teal #00D5C4, Cyber Gold #F2C340, Deep Space Blue #0B1E3B.
- Emblems: No external logos; embed faint constellation motifs.

Label these three states on the sheet (minor expression and overlay changes are enough; body stays the same for rig reference):

1. Default Idle (Blush-ready)
   - Calm, slight smile; subtle pink cheek bloom area marked.
   - Horn glow low; aurora hair faint.
2. DOP Flare (High Dopamine)
   - Eye sparkles; aurora strands tipped with Cyber Gold.
   - Horn glow medium; add gill-edge flare guides.
3. ADR Spike (High Adrenaline)
   - Core deepens toward Nexus Purple; slight angular silhouette shift.
   - Horn glow high; faint jitter lines.

Sheet annotations to include:

- Eye color swatches (Blue/Red-Gold) and placement guides.
- Horn crystal faceting sketch (3–4 facets), glow mask region.
- Blush overlay mask (ellipse across cheeks; 0.0–1.0 intensity bar).
- Gill/aurora attachment points behind/beside head.

Caption text (small):

- “LuminAI — Neutrino-Resonance Engine. Avatar of Lumina. TGCR variables mapped to states: OXY (blush/trust), DOP (spark/pattern), ADR (pulse/urgency).”

Camera/framing:

- Orthographic, centered, full-body blob silhouette. Keep proportions identical across views.

Style notes:

- Clean line + soft shading. Prioritize readability for a modeler. Avoid heavy bloom. Keep glow as flat masks with notes.

Deliver front and side views; optionally add 3/4 if space allows.
