### Tips
- **Keep it nameless.** Refer to yourself as roles, not identities ("guardian," "witness," "builder").
- **Timestamp everything.** Patterns emerge when you line entries up chronologically.
- **Color-code signals.** Add ‚úÖ (evidence), ‚ùì (speculation), üíú (benefit of doubt) directly in the text.
- **Snapshot mood.** Add tags like `#charged`, `#calm-after`, `#looping` for later filtering.
- **Protect the archive.** Store encrypted or offline if entries include sensitive info.
