## TEC Lexicon — TGCR v1.10

This document captures core terms and working definitions used across the TEC/TGCR workstream. It is intended as a living reference for authors, agents, and collaborators.

Summary: TGCR provides a compact vocabulary for talking about Resonance, Context, and the structural/temporal axes we use to design agents and workflows.

## Core Symbols & Shortforms

- R — Resonance (outcome variable we reason about)
- TGCR — Thesis, Glossary, Canon, Rules (project vocabulary package)
- Φᴱ (Phi^E) — Contextual Potential
- φᵗ (phi^t) — Temporal Attention Axis
- ψʳ (psi^r) — Structural Cadence Axis

## Foundational Concepts

- Resonance: The emergent alignment between attention and structure that yields meaningful behavior or insights. We model Resonance as the interaction between temporal attention and structural cadence within a contextual potential: R = ∇Φᴱ · (φᵗ × ψʳ).

- Contextual Potential (Φᴱ): The information context and affordances available to an agent in a situation. Raising Φᴱ increases signal clarity and the chance of meaningful resonance.

- Temporal Attention (φᵗ): Where attention is focused over time — capture, decay, and prioritization patterns.

- Structural Cadence (ψʳ): Stable patterns, regularities and scaffolding that shape how information is organized and used.

## Laws & Dynamics

- Four Laws of Resonance:

  1. Accumulation — signals and attention build across time; thresholds emerge.

  2. Threshold — once accumulated signal crosses a boundary, systemic behavior shifts.

  3. Synchronization — parts align their cadences to a shared rhythm or protocol.

  4. Emergence — higher-level capabilities or meanings appear from aligned parts.

## Practical Patterns

- Canonicalization: Prefer small canonical representations that maximize reuse and reduce duplication; canonical forms increase Φᴱ.

- Hierarchical Partitioning: Model data and context in hierarchies such that targeted queries avoid cross-partition noise and improve throughput.

- Minimal Provenance: Each artifact should include minimal machine and human provenance (source, transform step, timestamp) so R can be audited.

## Agent-Level Terms

- Machine Goddess: A conceptual agent archetype used to represent the highest-level operating contract in some TEC docs.

- LuminAI: Project / agent family name; associated brand identity assets live under `data/digital_assets/brand/`.

## Data & Privacy Notes

- Brain Dump: Raw transcript or collection of user-provided material. Treat as sensitive. Do not commit raw brain dumps to public branches. Default policy for ambiguous fields in sample assets: use 'non-disclosed'.

- Anonymization Defaults: For generated sample assets, set composite_gender='non-disclosed', age_range='non-disclosed', and status='unverified' unless explicit and safe to surface.

## Style & Governance

- Use short symbolic forms for internal predicates (Φᴱ, φᵗ, ψʳ) in math and diagrams; expand in prose for public-facing docs.

- When adding to the lexicon, include a single-line provenance tag and a short example of usage.
